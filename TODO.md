This file contains list of all todo items. An item can be either pending for
someone to pick it up, in progress by some volunteer or done.

ABBREVIATIONS
==============
* __DS:__ Dariusz Synowiec
* __DB:__ Dawid Bazan
* __KB:__ Dawid Bazan

IN PROGRESS
==============
* __DB:__ set up project with c


PENDING
==============
* Check if Thumb2 instructions for bitfields are generated by compiler by default
  or the additional sections are needed to use bitfield operations
* Investigate if when creating output file we can fill out empty flash space with some pattern like for e.g. 0x00
  Do we need this? will it be useful somehow?
* fix how to get rid of swj-dp.tcl from root
* link in openocd.cfg to files installed with open ocd, or put the note that when new version of openocd will be used this file must be updated.
* Test fastcode if this is working properly
* Vector 7 in interrupt is the checksum of data stored from vector 0 to 6. This must be implemented


DONE
==============
* __DS:__ add class LED as a part of the template to get feeling how to add new api
          modules in C++. This class shall be placed in h and cpp files which shall be
          treated as a template files (see point 2) c file doesn't need separate
          example of template(I think it should be the same like cpp) 
* __DS:__ Create assembler file and try to compile, test if properly passed compiler switches to asm.
* __DS:__ When compilation of some cpp or c file fails, the build process is not terminated. 
          Linker still tries to link not existed object files
* __DS:__ sym file recognize - it is generate by nm program, check `man nm`.
* __DS:__ resolve TODO items in makefile saying about not described parameter
* __DS:__ build log not created during compilation
* __DS:__ add some linker options so it generates more warnings (unknown sections etc.)
* __DS:__ dependences not included in makefile
* __DS:__ generated *flags.sub put in folder release/sub 
* __DS:__ File format for TODO items ;)
* __DS:__ listings not created during compilation
* __DS:__ dependences not created during compilation
* __DB:__ Set the initial stack pointer at the end of the RAM1 area
* __DB:__ Update startup file. Add: fastcode, heap, stack, ram2, ram3 sections(already done in linker)
* __DB:__ Linker script recognize all sections check which are needed
* __DB:__ Update LPC17xx.h with bitfields for GPIO to get access to single PINs
* __DB:__ Update Interrupt vector: missing definitions
* __DS:__ add SysTick module
* __DB:__ Compare linker script with the default provided by CMSIS for LPC17xx, see if wee need to update some sections 
* __DS:__ Format the code with specified rules (specify those rules)
